## Simulation of the Conway's Game of Life

The Conway's game of life consists to simulate lifecycle of cells with two states (life and death) and is ruled by simple rules. 
In a grid representing dead and living cells:
  - Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
  - Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
  - All other living cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
